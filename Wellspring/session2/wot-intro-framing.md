# WoT — Wellspring of Thoughts

## What It Is

Automated knowledge capture for yourself. You think, click, read, research — WoT captures, indexes, links, and retrieves so you can find your thoughts again.

## Human-Bot Co-Authorship

Tasks can be given to agents, broken down, sources retrieved and verified. Bots do the legwork — summarizing, linking, fetching — but you attest the outputs. Your signature, your judgment, their labor.

Chains of trust are computed and weighed to establish signal from noise. You configure which sources you trust, weighted by domain. High trust on technical matters, low on politics — whatever you decide. No central authority required to establish those links. Pure peer-to-peer with optional discovery.

## Artifacts With Provenance

Work product gets ejected with optional shared provenance. A document, a decision, a thread of reasoning — all with the trail of how it came to be. Share the conclusion, or share the whole journey. Your choice per artifact.

## Pools All The Way Down

Pools begat pools begat peers. A pool is just a scope — who can see, what's required, what capture fidelity. Your private pool feeds your team pool feeds your public pool. Or doesn't. The topology is yours.

This allows a totally dynamic public-private info sphere to emerge. No binary public/private — gradients of visibility, trust, and access, configured by social contract at each layer.

## What This Unlocks

**New gold rushes:**
- Search that respects your trust graph, not ad revenue
- Info provenance as a service — who said what, when, backed by whom
- Personal algorithms that work for you, running on your hardware

**Side effect:** A huge corpus of consented, attributed, provenance-rich data. Every correction labeled with model version and human verdict. Every thought with its because chain. Every edit with its rework history.

This is training data for the next generation of AI — with personal data sovereignty baked in, not bolted on.

## One Sentence

WoT is automated knowledge capture with human-bot co-authorship, peer-to-peer trust, and optional shared provenance — that happens to produce the cleanest AI training corpus ever assembled as a side effect.

*You keep your thoughts. You find them again. You share what you choose. The rest follows.*
