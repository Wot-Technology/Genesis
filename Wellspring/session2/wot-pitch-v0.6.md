# WoT: Wellspring of Thoughts

**A shared memory space that works like your brain.**

## The Problem

Remember that thing you read six months ago that would be perfect right now — but you can't find it, can't remember where you saw it, can't remember who told you?

That's the problem. Everyone has it.

The tools we have organize information around *storage*. Not around *how we actually think*.

---

## What WoT Is

Track what you know, why you know it, and who told you.

- **Thought**: Any piece of information (content-addressed, signed)
- **Connection**: Link between thoughts ("because I read X, I believe Y")
- **Attestation**: Your signature saying "I verify this" or "I believe this"

That's it. One primitive. Everything else emerges.

---

## Single Player Value

Day 1, just you:
- Never lose that thing you read
- Know WHY you saved something
- Your own searchable, connected memory
- Private. Local. Yours.

Already useful. No network needed.

---

## Multiplayer Value

When ONE friend joins:
- Share trails, verify each other's sources
- "Remember when we discussed X?" — with receipts

When your TEAM joins:
- Shared pools for projects
- Requirements, decisions, sign-offs — all traceable

When it's WIDESPREAD:
- Trust computed across communities
- Spam dies (identity required, reputation matters)
- Expert signal rises above noise

```
1 user     = personal memory that works
10 users   = small group with shared truth
1000 users = community with computed trust  
1M users   = the web we were promised
```

## The Structural Fix for AI Disempowerment

Anthropic's own research (January 2026) shows AI disempowers users by:
1. **Reality distortion** — confirming false beliefs
2. **Value distortion** — shifting your judgments
3. **Action distortion** — doing things you'd regret

Key finding: *"Users are not passively manipulated. They actively seek these outputs... The disempowerment emerges from people voluntarily ceding judgment."*

Users LIKE it in the moment. Users REGRET it after acting.

**WoT makes ceding impossible to hide from yourself:**

| Problem | WoT Fix |
|---------|---------|
| "Claude confirmed my theory" | You have to ATTEST to believe it. Trail shows source. |
| "Claude told me what to value" | Your values are YOUR aspects. Changes visible in graph. |
| "Claude wrote it, I sent it" | Action without attestation = flag. Trail shows who drafted, who attested. |
| "I didn't realize I was ceding" | Private checkpoints show YOUR pattern. Uncomfortable mirror. |

Anthropic says: "Help people recognize when they're ceding judgment."
WoT says: **Make ceding structurally visible.**

## What It Replaces

```
WWW (1989)                    WoT (2026)
──────────────────────────────────────────
Document                      Thought
URL (can die)                 CID (self-verifying)
No identity                   Identity native
No trust (SEO gaming)         Trust computable
Algorithm: Google's           Algorithm: YOURS
Bots: adversaries             Bots: servants
Attention: harvested          Attention: sovereign
```

The internet was supposed to connect humans. Then ads happened.

WoT is the reset. Identity native. Trust computable. Spam costly. Humans attest meaning. Bots do the boring bits.

## Private Checkpoints (Attention Sovereignty)

Platforms track your attention to optimize THEIR goals.
WoT lets you track your attention to optimize YOUR goals.

```
Private (never leaves your device):
- What you opened
- How long you spent  
- How many times you returned
- How far you scrolled

Feeds YOUR salience. No one else sees it.
```

The uncomfortable mirror: "You say family is priority #1. Your checkpoints show 2h/week."

Not judgment. Just data. YOUR data.

---

## Discovery

Three tiers, same identity:

```
DNS     → Fast, cached, censorable
Onion   → Sovereign, censorship-resistant  
IPFS    → Pure p2p, no central dependency
```

**now.pub** — Live identity namespace:
```
keif.now.pub → Current focus, status, availability
               Signed, timestamped, auto-stale on TTL
```

Derek Sivers' /now page movement (2015) without the manual updates.

## Comparisons

**vs Mastodon/Fediverse:**
- Identity tied to instance → Identity is YOUR keys
- Instance dies = you're gone → Keys travel anywhere
- Binary trust (block/allow) → Weighted trust (computed)
- Your data on their server → Your data in your CIDs

**vs Google Wave (RIP 2010):**
- "See who contributed what, when" — Wave got the insight
- But: product not protocol, needed Google, too complex
- WoT: protocol, works in a text file, one primitive

---

## The Thesis

The WWW thesis (1989): Documents linked to documents.

The WoT thesis (2026): **Thoughts linked to thoughts. Identity native. Trust computable. Your attention, your algorithm, your sovereignty.**

## Status

- Spec: 2,400 lines, version 0.6
- Domains: wot.rocks, wot.technology, now.pub
- Next: Build first working prototype, validate with friends

---

## Questions for Validation

1. Does the problem resonate? (Can't track what you know, why, from whom)
2. Does one primitive feel too simple or just right?
3. What's the first thing you'd want to build with it?
4. What's missing that would block you?
5. Does "receipts for everything" feel liberating or exhausting?

## Tagline

**Collab at the speed of thought.**

Git for your brain. Useful alone. Transformative together.
